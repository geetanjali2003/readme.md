<h2><p>In a world where gadgets never sleep,
And the Internet's dive is oh so deep,
There's a tale of bytes that love to leap,
From servers afar, in a boundless sweep.</p>

<p>Once a lonely pixel, quite discrete,
Met a vector line, oh so neat,
Together they danced, a visual treat,
On a retina display, their love complete.</p>

<p>A CPU with a heart of gold,
Tried to overclock, so bold,
But in the heat, it couldn't hold,
Now it whispers tales of silicon old.</p>

<p>In a valley where the coders type,
Bugs scurry away, full of hype,
But with a debug, they're just a gripe,
Turned to features, in the night's ripe.</p>

<p>Wi-Fi signals, they wave and flirt,
With devices nearby, no need for a shirt,
A connection made, data to blurt,
In a digital waltz, they expertly skirt.</p>

<p>So here's to tech, both big and small,
From the smartwatch wrap to the server hall,
May our gadgets live long and enthral,
In this funny, cool, tech carnival ball!</p>
